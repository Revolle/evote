# evote

Specification for *evote* system, for large community.

## Constraints :

- Distributed ( no central authority/system) 
- Unanimous ( all of its users participate on the validation )
- Immutable ( vote result cannot be altered )
- Confidential (nobody can extract a listing of "who vote what")
- transparency (all of its users can verify the result, and his own particpation in the vote)
- no physical influence during the vote (control that nobody influence the vote, like in a voting booth)

## Pre-requisit :

- external authentication mechanism (eg. FranceConnect)

## Main architecture :

Two layers of distributed ledger : 
- many micro-distibuted-ledgers "*e-electoral-office*" : similar to a temporary virtual small electoral office. Created "on the fly", to build a transaction of votes. An app manages this *e-electoral-office*. The communication between users of a *e-electoral-office* is only peer-to-peer and encrypted between users.
- one *vote-block-chain* which stores the events of status-changing of :
  - *e-electoral-office* : *pending*, *voting*, *cancelled*, *voted* with the counting. The *e-electoral-office-id* is used as identifier.
  - user : *voting*, *not-yet-vote*, *voted*. The *user-unique-id* is used as identifier.

One central *authentication-system* :
- has the list of *vote-block-chain*
- authenticate the users
- delivers a *user-unique-id* and user's face-photo to the *e-electoral-office*

### e-electoral-office use-case :

Starting the *e-electoral-office* app, the user makes an authentication on the external *authentication-system* and the *vote-block-chain* he needs. If the users has the right  status  in the *vote-block-chain*, the *authentication-system* sends back a *user-unique-id* and his face-photo. This *user-unique-id* is unique for the couple (user, *vote-block-chain*) and not reversible to the user. This *user-unique-id* is delivered to the user. This *user-unique-id* can be used by the user to check his status in the block-chain. The app writes in the *vote-block-chain* the status *voting* for this *user-unique-id*, with an *authentication-system* signature to validate the authentcity. The *authentication-system* writes in the *vote-block-chain* the status *registered* for this *user-unique-id*.

If there is no *e-electoral-office*  with status *pending* in the *vote-block-chain*, the *authentication-system*  creates an *e-electoral-office* in the *vote-block-chain*, with status *pending*. The the *authentication-system* sends to the app an id of a *e-electoral-office* with status *pending* , This id is signed by the *authentication-system*.

If the users leaves the app before the end of protocol, the app writes in the *vote-block-chain* the status *not-yet-vote* for this *user-unique-id*.

When a minimum of users are registered on the *pending* *e-electoral-office*, the voting protocole can start. This minimum should be more than 3 times the number of choices, and less than a "certain" value to avoid delay between the registration in the *e-electoral-office* and the start of the voting. The status of the *e-electoral-office* id added in *vote-block-chain* as *voting*. The id of *e-electoral-office* is delivered to the user. This id of *e-electoral-office* can be used by the user to check the transaction of his *e-electoral-office* in the block-chain. 

To vote, the user records a self-video, telling his choice, and making 360Â° panoramic view to show that is is alone. He confirms his vote clicking on the right check-box.
The app checks the face on the video against the face provided by the *authentication-system*. If the face control is correct, the face on the video is hidden. Else, the user must restart his vote.

The user's vote (video without face, and choice) is sent to two users part of his *e-electoral-office*. If the two users validates the vote (panoramic view, oral-choice=digital-choice), the vote is set as *correct* in the *e-electoral-office*. Else the vote is sent to another user, up to have two validations. If it is impossible to have a validation, the user can choose to restart his vote. The user can also leave from this *e-electoral-office* (the app writes in the *vote-block-chain* the status *not-yet-vote* for the *user-unique-id*).

When all votes are *correct* in the *e-electoral-office*, the list of user's-id/vote is sent to all the users of the *e-electoral-office*. 
If all participants validate the list, the *e-electoral-office* is declared as *voted* in the *vote-block-chain*, with the list of *user-unique-id*, and the counting of votes, and the id of *e-electoral-office* signed by the *authentication-system*. Who vote what is not available in the result of the *e-electoral-office*. The app writes in the *vote-block-chain* the status *voted* for the *user-unique-id*. 

If the participants does not validate the list, the *e-electoral-office* is declared as *non-valid* in the *vote-block-chain*, and the app writes in the *vote-block-chain* the status *not-yet-vote* for the *user-unique-id*.

### vote-block-chain :

The *vote-block-chain* stores these events :
- change status of *e-electoral-office* , identified with a *e-electoral-office-id* ( *pending* , *voting*, *voted* with the the result of the votes)
- change status of user, identified with a *e-electoral-office*-id delivered by *authentication-system* ( *voting* , *noy_yet_vote*, *voted* )

A user can verify his status (using his *user-unique-id* )and his transaction ( using his *e-electoral-office-id*).

A user can count the global result of the vote, reading and summing the counts of *e-electoral-office* with status *voted* in the *vote-block-chain*, with the id of *e-electoral-office* signed by the *authentication-system* , and where the *user-unique-id* is set as *registered* in the *vote-block-chain* by the *authentication-system*.

## Resilience

### flooding of votes

issue : A hacker inserts false status in the *vote-block-chain* , simulating many users with *user-unique-id*, voting in many *e-electoral-office*.

resilience : The counting of votes ignores these votes, because the *user-unique-id* are not set as *registered* in the *vote-block-chain* by the *authentication-system*, and/or the id of  *e-electoral-office* is not signed by the *authentication-system* 

### obstacle to validate a vote

issues : only zero or one user in an *e-electoral-office* validates the vote of the user, because other users consider that his choice is "incorrect" for personl reasons.

resilience : increase the minimum of users in the *e-electoral-office* to avoid possible majority. Else, the user can change to another *e-electoral-office*

### reuse identity

issue : A hacker inserts false status in the *vote-block-chain* , reusing many users with existing *user-unique-id*, voting in many *e-electoral-office*.

resilience : The counting of votes ignores these votes, because the *user-unique-id* is not signed by the *authentication-system* . The signature of the id of an *e-electoral-office* is given by the *authentication-system* when a user is authenticatd and asiigned to an *e-electoral-office*.

### reveal vote under constraint

issue : A hacker asks the user his  *user-unique-id*, and reads the *e-electoral-office*.

resilience : The *e-electoral-office* contains the number of votes, and the *user-unique-id*. But it does not contain the list (*user-unique-id*,his vote). The vote can be revealed only in case of unanimity in the *e-electoral-office* : increase the minimum of users in the *e-electoral-office* to avoid possible unanimity.
